# ChatGPT-assisted data processing and visualization (2 case-based demonstrations)
## Background
- **Data processing and visualization** are becoming increasely important and offer great job opportunities
- **ChatGPT** can improve work productivity and are revolutionizing almost every industry 
## Tools used in this presentation
- jupyter-lab: a web-based interactive computing platform, useful for demonstration
- Python: the most popular general-purpose programming language
- ChatGPT:

## Case 1: Visualize the copy number data of *OPRIII* gene in 76 barley varieties/genomes
- gene can be duplicated into different copies in the genome
- *OPRIII* displays gene dosage effect and controls root length 
- high copy of *OPRIII* leads to longer and no-branch roots, while low copy results in shorter and more branchy root
### Case 2: Processing and visualization of the correlation of gene copy number with barley phenology traits
- phenotype data (flowering time, grain yield, plant height) of 500 barley varieties
- sequencing read depth of 165 barley genes related to plant phenology
- investigate if any association between gene copy number and phenology traits
