```
## Case 1: Visualize the copy number data of *OPRIII* gene in 76 barley varieties/genomes
```
a) gene can be duplicated into different copies in the genome
b) *OPRIII* displays gene dosage effect and controls root length 
c) high copy of *OPRIII* leads to longer and no-branch roots, while low copy results in shorter and more branchy root
```
### Case 2: Processing and visualization of the correlation of gene copy number with barley phenology traits
```
a) phenotype data (flowering time, grain yield, plant height) of 500 barley varieties 
b) sequencing read depth of 165 barley genes related to plant phenology
c) investigate if any association between gene copy number and phenology traits
